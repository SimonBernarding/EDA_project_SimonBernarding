# ds-project-template

Template for creating ds simple projects

## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.11.3

## Setup

One of the first steps when starting any data science project is to create a virtual environment. For this project you have to create this environment from scratch yourself. However, you should be already familiar with the commands you will need to do so. The general workflow consists of... 

* setting the python version locally to 3.11.3
* creating a virtual environment using the `venv` module
* activating your newly created environment 
* upgrading `pip` (This step is not absolutely necessary, but will save you trouble when installing some packages.)
* installing the required packages via `pip`

At the end, you want to make sure that people who are interested in your project can create an identical environment on their own computer in order to be able to run your code without running into errors. Therefore you can create a `requirements file` and add it to your repository. You can create such a file by running the following command: 

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

*Note: In rare case such a requirements file created with `pip freeze` might not ensure that another (especially M1 chip) user can install and execute it properly. This can happen if libraries need to be compiled (e.g. SciPy). Then it also depends on environment variables and the actual system libraries.*

### Unit testing (Optional)

If you write python scripts for your data processing methods, you can also write unit tests. In order to run the tests execute in terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will execute all the functions in your project that start with the word **test**.


## Set up your Environment
This repo contains a requirements.txt file with a list of all the packages and dependencies you will need. Before you install the virtual environment, make sure to install postgresql if you haven't done it before.

 - Check the **postgresql version**  by run the following commands:
    ```sh
    psql --version
    ```
    If you haven't installed it yet, begin at `step_1`. Otherwise, proceed to `step_2`.


Before you can start with plotly in Jupyter Lab you have to install node.js (if you haven't done it before).
- Check **Node version**  by run the following commands:
    ```sh
    node -v
    ```
    If you haven't installed it yet, begin at `step_2`. Otherwise, proceed to `step_3`.


### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 

- `Step_1:` Update Homebrew and install Postgresql by following commands:
    ```sh
    brew update
    brew install postgresql@14
    ```
  Restart Your Terminal and than check the **postgresql version**  by run the following commands:
     ```sh
    psql --version
    ```
  If `psql --version` doesn't display the version, add PostgreSQL to your macOS PATH by following these steps:

  * Find and copy the PostgreSQL bin directory on macOS.
  
    The default path is typically `/Library/PostgreSQL/<version>/bin`, where is your PostgreSQL version.
  * Edit the .zshrc or a similar .conf file using a text editor like Nano, Vim, or VSCode.

     ```sh
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
  * Add the following line to the .zshrc file. Make sure to replace <version> with your PostgreSQL version.
    ```sh
    export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/<version>/bin:$PATH"
    ```
  * Save and exit the text editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + O, then Enter, and then Ctrl + X to exit.
  * Restart Your Terminal
    ```sh
    source ~/.zshrc
    psql --version
    ```


- `Step_2:` Update Homebrew and install Node by following commands:
    ```sh
    brew update
    brew install node
    ```

- `Step_3:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- `Step_1:` Update Chocolatey and install Postgresql by following commands:
    ```sh
    choco upgrade chocolatey
    choco install postgresql14
    ```
    Restart Your Terminal and than check the **postgresql version**  by run the following commands:
     ```sh
    psql --version
    ```
  If `psql --version` doesn't display the version, add PostgreSQL to your winOS PATH by following these steps:

  * Find and copy the PostgreSQL bin directory on winOS.

    The default path is typically `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin`, where <version> is your PostgreSQL version.

  * Open Command Prompt as Administrator:

    * Search for "Command Prompt" in your Start menu.
    * Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator."

  * Add PostgreSQL to PATH:
    * Replace 14 with your PostgreSQL version if it's different.

    ```PowerShell
    setx PATH "$($env:PATH);C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin"
    ```
  * Close the Administrator Command Prompt window.


  * Open a new Terminal and run the following command 
    ```PowerShell
    psql --version
    ```

- `Step_2:` Update Chocolatey and install Node by following commands:
    ```sh
    choco upgrade chocolatey
    choco install nodejs
    ```

- `Step_3:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-Bash` CLI :
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 

 **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:

   ```Bash
   python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
